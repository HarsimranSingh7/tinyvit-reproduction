## Implementation of TinyViT-5M Architecture

I've successfully implemented the TinyViT-5M architecture as described in the paper. The implementation includes:

1. **Building Blocks (models/blocks.py)**:
   - PatchEmbed: Converts images to patch embeddings
   - PatchMerging: Hierarchical feature map downsampling
   - MBConv: Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks for early stages
   - TransformerBlock: Standard transformer blocks with attention and MLP
   - Attention: Multi-head self-attention mechanism
   - Mlp: MLP blocks used in transformer layers

2. **Main Architecture (models/tinyvit.py)**:
   - Implemented the full TinyViT model with configurable parameters
   - Created the TinyViT-5M variant with appropriate embedding dimensions, depths, and heads
   - Added proper initialization and forward methods
   - Verified parameter count matches the expected ~5.4M parameters

## Fast Distillation Framework

I've implemented the fast distillation framework described in the paper:

1. **Logit Distillation (distillation/logit_distill.py)**:
   - Created a FastDistillation class that handles:
     - Precomputing and storing sparse teacher logits (top-k values)
     - Loading and saving logits to disk for efficiency
     - Computing distillation loss using the stored logits
   - Implemented temperature scaling for the distillation loss
   - Added support for batch processing with unique image IDs

## Verification

Both components have been verified with test scripts:

- 	est_model.py: Confirms parameter count and forward pass
- 	est_distillation.py: Tests the distillation framework

## Next Steps

- Implement training utilities
- Create data loading utilities
- Build training scripts
- Run experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet subset
